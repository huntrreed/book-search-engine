 # Book Search Engine

 
 ## Description
The Book Search Engine is a full-stack MERN application that uses GraphQL and the Apollo Server to provide a platform for readers to find and keep track of books theyâ€™ve read or want to read.  Users can search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorites to their account, and manage their saved list by removing or adding new books.
